#### About Me
I am EvilSquirrelGuy, the Owner and Leader of [OS-Games-Official](https://www.github.com/OS-Games-Official/). I use GitHub to upload various bits and bobs and I'm using it for bug tracking for one of my big projects 
#### My Projects
I'm currently working on 2 things:
- [A game](https://www.github.com/OS-Games-Official/SoulsOfTheForest) (and no I'm not stupid enough to publish the source code, lol.)
- [A Minecraft hacked client](https://www.github.com/EvilSquirrelGuy/SquirrelClient), and yes, I'll make this one open source when I start it eventually...
