#### About Me
I am EvilSquirrelGuy, the Owner and Leader of [OS-Games-Official](https://www.github.com/OS-Games-Official/). I use GitHub to upload various bits and bobs and I'm using it for bug tracking for one of my big projects.
 
#### My Projects
I'm currently working on 2 things:
- [A game](https://www.github.com/OS-Games-Official/SoulsOfTheForest) (and no I'm not stupid enough to publish the source code, lol.)
- [A Minecraft hacked client](https://www.github.com/EvilSquirrelGuy/SquirrelClient), yes, I'll make this one open source when I start it eventually...

#### Project Status
```diff
+ Currently working on v0.0.4 of Souls of the Forest
#   To Alpha Testers: Keep submitting bug reports and suggestions

- Not working on SquirrelClient
```

#### Message
```
Why didn't you vote for the Iceologer, the glow squid is actually useless, we NEED more hostile mobs
